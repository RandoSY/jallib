 * In a PIC, *analog IO are enabled by default*. If you want to use digital IO, you have to explicitly enable them, using `enable_digital_io()` procedure. No one will do it for you...

 * *pins are inputs by default*. If you want them to be output, you need to configure them. Ex: `pin_A0_direction = output`.
