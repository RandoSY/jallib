#summary This page show the validation results to create jallib 0.1beta release
#labels Phase-QA

I've taken the voting system from Apache (http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html). Here are the rules (from this page):

"""

The in-between values are indicative of how strongly the voting individual feels. Here are some examples of fractional votes and ways in which they might be intended and interpreted:

|| *+0* || 'I don't feel strongly about it, but I'm okey with this.' ||
|| *-0* || 'I won't get in the way, but I'd rather we didn't do this.' ||
|| *-0.5* || 'I don't like this idea, but I can't find any rational justification for my feelings.' ||
|| *++1* || 'Wow! I like this! Let's do it!' ||
|| *-0.9* || 'I really don't like this, but I'm not going to stand in the way if everyone else wants to go ahead with it.' ||
|| *+0.9* || 'This is a cool idea and i like it, but I don't have time/the skills necessary to help out.' ||

"""


You've noted there's no veto vote, so the majority wins :) 
Once the vote is done, all files which are *positive* (majority agree) goes to the "validated" map (move ?, copy ?)
