#summary This page show the validation results to create jallib 0.1beta release
#labels Phase-QA

Instead of a "OK/KO" voting system, I've taken the voting system from Apache (http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html). This helps expressing more than a binary opinion, which often not the case. Here are the rules (inspired from this page):

"""

The in-between values are indicative of how strongly the voting individual feels. Here are some examples of fractional votes and ways in which they might be intended and interpreted:


|| -1   || I really don't like this, but I'm not going to stand in the way if everyone else wants to go ahead with it. ||
||  0   || I don't any opinion on this... ||
|| +1   || I don't feel strongly about it, but I'm okey with this. ||
|| +2   || This is cool ! ||
|| +3   || Wow! I like this! Amazing ! ||

"""


You've noted there's no veto vote, so the majority wins :) Ideally, absolute majority is the goal. When there's a negative vote, we have to discuss to better know we all have understood the problem. The jallib group is here to help: put a "validate" or the the like in the subject, so we all know what this is about.

Once the vote is done, all files which are *positive* (majority agree, score > 0) goes to the "validated" map (move ?, copy ?)

Finally, before voting, every jal file must first fulfill the [ValidationProcess validation process] (3 criteria)
