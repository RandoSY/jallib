This page describes how to install, configure and use the "jallib" wrapper script.

= What is the "jallib" wrapper script ? =

"jallib" script can handle common tasks when working with the SVN repository. Tasks include compiling, validating, registering test results, generating doc, etc... Whether you're a user, a tester or a developper, you may want to have a look at it !


= Installing "jallib" =

The script itself is a python script. It uses several dependencies. You have two options: either you can use the binary executable, or you can install all dependencies.

== All-in-one binary ==

There's currently a windows binary, which embed all these dependencies, including python itself ! If you're able to use this binary (ie. you're under windows, or you have `wine` installed for linux users), this is the fastest way to have "jallib" working. Unfortunately, there's currently only a windows binary.

To make sure it's working for you:

{{{
cd tools
jallib.exe
jallib.exe help
}}}

should inform you about about how to get help.

Under linux, if you can't install dependencies, you may want to try it using `wine`

{{{
cd tools
wine jallib.exe
wine jallib.exe help
}}}


== Installing dependencies ==

The binary distribution drawback is it's slower than using the script the straight way, that is, with all dependencies installed. This is because when you run the binary, it has to uncompress all the content before running it.

So, whether you want it faster or can't use the binary, you have to install dependencies. Don't worry, it's not that complicated...

First, install python 2.5 (it may run with python 2.6):

 * http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.2/
   * for linux & others, use your package distrib, or install using sources
   * windows installation is straightforward

Then install Cheetah 2.0.1:

 * http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=28961&package_id=20864
   * installation is standard: unpack, and run `python setup.py install` (note, under windows, if python is not in your %PATH%, this should look like `c:\python25\python setup.py install`)

Install YAML 

 * http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
   * again, install should be easy, `python setup.py install`

Install wikify library:

 * get the file here: http://cspace.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/wikify.py
   * there's no install script, so do it manually
   * linux: copy the file to `/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages`
   * windows: copy file to `c:\python25\lib\site-packages`
   * you can also put it in another directory, and use your PYTHONPATH settings (if you don't know what it is, try the former methods)

Finally, install pysvn. This is the trickiest part. You'll need a pysvn library built for SVN >=1.5 (and not SVN 1.4 for instance).

 * http://pysvn.tigris.org/project_downloads.html
   * linux: you can install it using the package distrib (eg. `apt-get install python-svn`), but be sure you have it built against SVN >=1.5. You can of course build it using sources
   * windows: use installation kit. Remember: python2.5 + svn1.5. This is worked for me: http://pysvn.tigris.org/files/documents/1233/43132/py25-pysvn-svn150-1.6.0-975.exe
   * macos: there are also mac os install kits (not tested)
   * if not correctly installed, you'll have an error message saying you can't use this action because the library is not installed. Another error will occur if you did not install the correct version ("client too old").
