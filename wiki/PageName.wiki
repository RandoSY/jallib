Jallib Style Guid

= Introduction =

This is the guide how the Jal V2 libraries should be written.

It details:

author, licence, fuctions, etc

-FIXME:
do we make all library filenames lower case with underscores?


= Device File =

The device file is (preferably) automatically generated from a Microchip INC file and contains information about all ports and special function registers.

It lists the various configuration settings. 

Proposed name: picxxfyyyy_dev.jal (at least for a flash PIC)

= Init File = 

-FIXME:
How do we call the file which sets the clock speed, analog functions, etc? 
Init library?  picxxfyyyy_init.jal

By default, the init file makes all pins digital IO and sets a standard xtal speed.


= Super Lib =

The superlib includes all possible hardware libraries that are used on the PIC and sets the default needed parameters for these libs. It also includes paramaters that have a defualt setting in the library, so need not be declared by the user, in comments, with the default value. Example:
 

const baudrate = 2400

-- const nine_bit_tx    = false
-- const nine_bit_rx    = false
-- const synchronous = false


include serial_hardware_16


const SPI_mode  = true
const master    = true

-- const clock_polarity_idle_high = true

include SPI

const I2C_mode = false              -- both SPI and I2C can't be enabled

include I2C
  



Since the hardware libs have their default values, direct messing with configuration bits in special function regs should happen after including the lib.
