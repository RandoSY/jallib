#style guide for writing sample programs


= Sample Programs =

== Purpose ==

The sample programs in the jallib depository are written to give an example how to use the various libraries. The should live in the /samples directory, and created in /unvalidated/samples. If they work well enough, they can be *moved* to /validated.

They are aimed at newbies, but some experience may be expected, depending on the application. For instance: a blink-a-LED program should be very explicit with lots of comments. An SPI example can be more difficult.

== Header ==

The header should at leas have the following information: (example)
